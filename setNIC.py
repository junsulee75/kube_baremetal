'''
To modifify flannel yaml file to give master node internal interface name.

example)

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    app: flannel
    k8s-app: flannel
    tier: node
  name: kube-flannel-ds
...
      containers:
      - args:
        - --ip-masq
        - --kube-subnet-mgr
        - --iface=eth0     <======

By default, this is not set, then flannel would find the interface. 
But no guarantee for finding the correct one. 

This program will help to create new modifiled yaml file.

    '''
    The error ValueError: I/O operation on closed file is happening 
    because yaml.safe_load_all() reads from the file after it has already been closed in the with open(...) as yamlFile block.   
    When yaml.safe_load_all(yamlFile) returns a generator, the actual reading occurs when iterating over it later, but by that time, the file has already been closed.
    To resolve this issue, load all the YAML data while the file is still open. You can achieve this by converting data into a list
